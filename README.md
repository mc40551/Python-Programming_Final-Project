# PythonProgramming_FinalProject
A website aggregator that aggregates sources from multiple webistes

It would be built using Flask in Python, and the frontend of the website would use HTML and CSS.
The program would take in API keys of the target websites, parse the information retrieved, then display the information on the website.
The news articles would be divided into pages, with next and back buttons.  Each article should include its publishing date and source.
The Reddit section should display one page of the top posts.
The Twitch section would display an embedded video of a stream.

Week 4: get access to all my API keys.

Week 5: Working on Python code that retrieve and parse data of each section

Week 6: Continue to work on different sections

Week 7: Build the website and put together each section

Week 8: Finish up the project to make sure each section displays information properly
